<p> Nuts melt in her mouth
But not in her hand
No need to figure it out
She just likes M&Ms
Sweet to the taste
Bitter in the gut
'Cause she fills them up
With you know what
She will not be shamed (She will not be shamed)
She will not be blamed (She will not be blamed)
When she confuses a tune
She blames it on you
Screaming, "You're insane, you're insane"<p/>
