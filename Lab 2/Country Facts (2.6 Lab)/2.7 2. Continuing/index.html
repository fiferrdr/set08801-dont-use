<h1>Before Organized Cheerleading</h1>
<p>Cheerleading began during the late 18th century with the rebellion of male students. 
After the American Revolutionary War, students experienced harsh treatment 
from teachers. In response to faculty's abuse, college students violently acted out.
 The undergraduates began to riot, burn down buildings located on their 
 college campuses, and assault faculty members. As a more subtle way to 
 gain independence, however, students invented and organized their 
 own extracurricular activities outside their professors' control. 
 This brought about American sports, beginning first with collegiate teams.</p>
